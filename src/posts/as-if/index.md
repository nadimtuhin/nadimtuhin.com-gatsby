<br> As if I'm lost in darkness,
<br> As if there's no sound.
<br> As if I'm lifeless,
<br> Yet my heart pounds.
<br> 
<br> As if I cry and smile,
<br> At the same time.
<br> As if I sing and mourn,
<br> In the same rhyme.
<br> 
<br> As if someone I could hear,
<br> As if I'm numb within fear.
<br> As if someone dear,
<br> Yet I'm broken into tear.
<br> 
<br> As if we laugh,
<br> As if each of us is half.
<br> As if we love,
<br> As if pieces of a broken heart.
<br> 
<br> As if two poles of earth,
<br> As if to feel each otherâ€™s dearth.
<br>
